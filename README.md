# Termux

For those who have difficulty using Termux, here's a very basic tutorial.

1. Install the F-Droid app

F-Droid is a library of Android apps, similar to the Play Store. The difference is that F-Droid is exclusive to open-source apps.

- [Official F-Droid website](fdroid.org)

<a href="https://fdroid.org"><img src="https://content.invisioncic.com/v310067/monthly_2022_07/f-droid.png.9c45eb46593f3eb4276b56b7e5534118.png" alt="What is F-droid" width=300px></a>

As it's an app outside the Play Store, you may need to allow some permissions during the installation process.

2. Install Termux

Open F-Droid, search for Termux, and click install. Termux is a powerful terminal emulator and Linux environment for Android. It allows the installation of various packages (like Node.js) using the apt and pkg libraries.

3. Install Node.js

Open Termux. We'll use the apt library to install Node.js. But before that, let's update the library. Enter the following commands:

```bash
apt update
apt upgrade
```

If there's any prompt during installation, just press Enter.

To install Node.js, enter the command:

```bash
apt install nodejs
```

After installation, we can run Node on our Android device.

Then just start by typing the command
```bash
npm i && npm run build && npm run start
```
